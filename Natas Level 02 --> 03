> Again we have the same prompt, going to keep my eyes on URL more often now but not expecting the same thing from last lvl

> Inspected the page, didn't find anything really besides "No more information leaks!! Not even Google will find it this time"

> I'm guessing google has something to do with getting this answer

> Going to google informayion leak tools relating to google

> Ok so after much googling I found that I need to use robots.txt at the end of my URL
  A robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site. 
  This is used mainly to avoid overloading your site with requests; it is not a mechanism for keeping a web page out of Google. 
  To keep a web page out of Google, block indexing with noindex or password-protect the page.

> Adding robots.txt at the end of the URL brought me to a txt page with User-agent:* and Disallow: /s3cr3t/

> Going to try to add that at the end of the URL now 

> Yup that seemed to bring me to another user.txt file and in it had the password
