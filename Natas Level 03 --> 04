Goal/Hint 

Access disallowed. You are visiting from "" while authorized users should come only from "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"

Refresh Page Option

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Of course the first thing I do is hit the refresh page which gave me:
  Access disallowed. You are visiting from "http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org/" while authorized users should come only from "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"

> So it looks like I need to be natas5 in order to view the page due to permissions

> So was stumped but found out that I needed to be using Blurp Suite. 

> Downloaded Blurp Suite and downloaded proxy on an extension and inputted the requirements for blurpsuite

> With the proxy on we refresh the natas page and then head over to Blurp Suite to see if we caught the packet through there

> We did and I open to inspect what we have captured

> Nothing looks too different packet wise, we have new tools to use but not exectly sure how to use them

> Learned through some googling that if we take the packet we have and add a Referer leading to http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/
  it should bypass and get permission as Natas4

> Ok so from target proxy we sent the packet to a repeater where we then added the Referer with the address acting as natas5

> After the addation I then ran the new packet and it returned what looked like to be the last packet but at the bottom
  it contained the password 

> Password for Natas5 = 0n35PkggAPm2zbEpOU802c0x0Msn1ToK

> This was more trouble than ut probably should have, but I didn't understand I needed Blurp Suite and how to use it tools,
  but if anything I glad to have gained more knowledge and hope to get more hands on with it in the future
