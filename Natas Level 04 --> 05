Natas 04 --> 05

Goal/Hint 

Access disallowed. You are not logged in

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> First look at it and it seems pretty simple in the fact that the site is not recognizing that we are indeed logged in. 

> Going to keep using Blurp Suite and inspect the page

> So upon inspection of the proxy packet I can see that there is a line that is "logged in = 0"

> So just thinking here but usually something that is either a yes or no in code is basically binary, 
  so train of thought is just changing the 0 to a 1

> Send to repeater to make the change than run it again

> Yup just like that access has been granted and we got the password for Natas6

> Password for Natas6 = 0RoJwHdSKWFTYR5WuiAewauSuNaBXned
