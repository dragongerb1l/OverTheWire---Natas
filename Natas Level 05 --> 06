> Ok so we can type and search things in this level, not exectly sure what but we can view the sourcecode so lets start there

> Ok so I can see some code in here that different than before and relating to "secret"

# Post code below
<?

include "includes/secret.inc";

    if(array_key_exists("submit", $_POST)) {
        if($secret == $_POST['secret']) {
        print "Access granted. The password for natas7 is <censored>";
    } else {
        print "Wrong secret";
    }
    }
?>

> So first thing that comes to my mind is the includes/secret.inc 

> We've seen soemthing like this before so I'm going to start there, paste that at the end of the URL

> Yup we got the password just like that seems too easy

> Password for Natas7 = FOEIUWGHFEEUHOFUOIU
