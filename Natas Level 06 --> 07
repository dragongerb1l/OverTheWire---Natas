Home & About Weblinks 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> So we have two clickable links here and of course I'm going to hit both of them

> When clicking the home page it returns that "this is the front page"

> End of that URL becomes index.php?page=home

> When clicking on the About page it returns "this is the about page"

> End of URL becomes index.php?page=about

? I am going to check the sourcecode and there I see <!-- hint: password for webuser natas8 is in /etc/natas_webpass/natas8 -->

> Again the path is what is telling me what I should try next so that I will do 

> Ok so at first it did not work, I was getting rid of the path after the .org but in this case we just had to delete "home" 
  then paste the /etc/natas_webpass/natas8

> The password for natas8 = xcoXLmzMkoIP9D7hlgPlh9XD7OgLAe5Q
