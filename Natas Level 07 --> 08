Goal/Hint

Input secret: text search - submit query

View Sourcecode

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Ok so again we have a search tool and we can view the sourcecode

> Going to view sourcecode again first to see if anything pops put to me

> OK got new code here and it looks like they give us a secret code that has been encrypted

# Sourcecode 

$encodedSecret = "3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362";

function encodeSecret($secret) {
    return bin2hex(strrev(base64_encode($secret)));
}

if(array_key_exists("submit", $_POST)) {
    if(encodeSecret($_POST['secret']) == $encodedSecret) {
    print "Access granted. The password for natas9 is <censored>";
    } else {
    print "Wrong secret";
    }

> So looking at the code I can see its been encrypted bin2hex then strrev, then base64

> So I'm guessing I need to work backwards to decode it

> I was wrong after trying base64 decode first it made no sense when trying to apply the other decoders

> I found to use cyberchef as a good decoder

> Didn't know what strrev was so googled it and it came back as a tool that reverses a string 

> So we first decode the secret from hex since we can see it was binary 2 hex

> ==QcCtmMml1ViV3b is the binary that we now need to reverse back

> b3ViV1lmMmtCcQ== is the reverse and now we just need to base64 decode and we should have the secret

> oubWYf2kBq is what we get for the final return 

> Plug that into the search query

>Returns the password 

> Password for Natas9 = ZE1ck82lmdGIoErlhQgWND6j2Wzz6b6t
